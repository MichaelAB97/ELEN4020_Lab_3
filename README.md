# Word Index
This was implemented using the mrs MapReduce framework
This can be run by running the runWordIndex.py file in terminal, which automatically searches through all three files - small.txt, large.txt and very_large.txt.
It also makes use of the stopWords.txt file.
The results are stored in their respective output folders.
